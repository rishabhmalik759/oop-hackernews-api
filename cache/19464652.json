I was shocked to hear from multiple companies, large and small, that they did not want men and white men in particular.<p>Now we see a YC co-founder giving 40 women $9000 to learn to program.<p>Where does it end? I was really sad that while I personally can survive in this environment (if I abandon my ideals of not being judged by my genetics), many good men who are passionate about their work are being pressured from all sides.<p>I honestly don’t see how any of this is legal but it’s such a taboo to talk about that fixing the problem seems impossible without a major shift back to valuing skills above demographics.","time":1553275127,"type":"comment","createdOn":"2021-12-14T10:33:47.961","ttl":600}
