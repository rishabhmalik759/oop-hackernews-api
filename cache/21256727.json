The only argument against them is that they&#x27;re not mnemonic. But (a) more mnemonic names tend to be over-specific (not all cdrs are tails), and (b) after a week of using Lisp, car and cdr mean the two halves of a cons cell, and languages should be designed for people who&#x27;ve used them for more than a week.","time":1571130102,"type":"comment","createdOn":"2021-12-13T23:45:37.137","ttl":600}
