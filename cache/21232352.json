All other things (e.g. libraries) being equal, language A is better than language B if programs are shorter in A. (As measured by the size of the parse tree, obviously, not lines or characters.) The goal of Bel is to be a good language. This can be measured in the length of programs written in it.<p>Lisp dialects have as a rule been good at making programs short. Bel is meant to do the same sorts of things previous dialects have, but more so.<p>It&#x27;s also meant to be simple and clear. If you want to understand Bel&#x27;s semantics, you can read the source.","time":1570881614,"type":"comment","createdOn":"2021-12-13T23:45:49.211","ttl":600}
