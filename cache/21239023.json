Starting with an initial phase where you care just about the concepts and not at all about efficient implementation almost guarantees you&#x27;re going to have to discard some things from that phase when you make a version to run on the computers of your time. But I think it&#x27;s still a good exercise to start out by asking &quot;what would I do if I didn&#x27;t count the cost?&quot; before switching to counting the cost, instead of doing everything in one phase and having your thinking constrained by worries about efficiency.<p>So cleverness in implementation won&#x27;t translate into compliance, but rather into inventing declarations that programmers can use that will make their programs dramatically faster. E.g. if programmers are willing to declare that they&#x27;re not going to look inside or modify literals, you don&#x27;t have to actually represent functions as lists. And maybe into making really good programming tools.<p>As I said elsewhere, half jokingly but also seriously, this language is going to give implementors lots of opportunities for discovering new optimization techniques.","time":1570952367,"type":"comment","createdOn":"2021-12-13T23:45:42.962","ttl":600}
