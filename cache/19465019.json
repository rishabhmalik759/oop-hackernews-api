She was incensed because she was invited to a &#x27;Girls Code&#x27; meetup, where women would learn about algorithms by modelling their own menstrual cycles[0]. She was (understandably) frustrated, saying that her interests extend beyond what comes out of her genitals.<p>This is anecdotal, sure, but amongst my social circle, this seems to be the rule rather than the exception.<p>I sense a bazillion downvotes coming my way. You may think these opinions I am passing along are incredibly incorrect, but they <i>are</i> the opinions of <i>women</i>.<p>[0]: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;jFLU0C8\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgur.com&#x2F;a&#x2F;jFLU0C8</a><p>EDIT: It took no time at all for the downvotes to arrive, as expected. There is no such thing as the sisterhood. Feminists will immediately cast out any woman who doesn&#x27;t hold the &quot;right&quot; opinions.","time":1553277196,"type":"comment","createdOn":"2021-12-14T10:33:47.397","ttl":600}
