More diverse companies, different types of people to bounce ideas on, new perspectives. This is what our industry needs more than ever, and yet so many feel a threat veiled by concerns of affirmative action and &#x27;reverse discrimination&#x27;.<p>We need to acknowledge the barriers that have existed in our industry but may be blind to you personally because you never had to deal with it. For one, access to a PC for a long time was restricted to those with low incomes. My mother saved her income tax refund for two years to buy our first PC, the one I learned to program on. The schools I attended didn&#x27;t have a computer lab until my junior year of high school. It&#x27;s a great thing that programming is being spread to those who did not have access before. If software is eating the world everyone had better become familiar.","time":1553281381,"type":"comment","createdOn":"2021-12-14T10:32:56.061","ttl":600}
