This is a private individual giving personal capital to other private individuals, supporting a personal cause. It is hard to both claim principles of free market and rally against this.<p>2. Private companies making hiring decisions are correcting for an indefinite history of bias. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re hiring unqualified individuals, simply that they&#x27;re making sure they put in measure to correct for biases and can identify individuals with the great qualifications that in the past would have been past up due to arbitrary euphemisms for gender &#x2F; racial bias like &#x27;bad culture fit&#x27;.<p>3. None of this is to say that you personally are not experiencing a challenging time or are not subject to bias in any way. None of this should diminish your personal challenges in the work environment. That should be addressed. This particular individual (@jl) and this particular company (Lambda School) are just not addressing that particular cause at this moment. And that should be ok.","time":1553277713,"type":"comment","createdOn":"2021-12-14T10:32:54.975","ttl":600}
